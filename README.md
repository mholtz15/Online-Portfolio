# Online-Portfolio
Online Portfolio using HTML and CSS <br>
<br>
I created an online Portfolio as a small project in which I thought would be interesting to see how I can make my CV/Resume into something interactive and much more enjoyable to look at. I created this using HTML and CSS.

<i> I have attached some images of what the homepage of the online portfolio looks like: </i>

The project is not completed as yet - which explains why you can see that the information on my skills - however I jus wanted to showcase what it looks to users on the website. All buttons, links and pages work as intended.
