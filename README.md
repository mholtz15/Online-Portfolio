# Online-Portfolio
Online Portfolio using HTML and CSS <br>
<br>
I created an online Portfolio as a small project in which I thought would be interesting to see how I can make my CV/Resume into something interactive and much more enjoyable to look at. I created this using HTML and CSS. 
<br>
<br>
<i> I have attached some images of what the homepage of the online portfolio looks like: </i>

The project is not completed as yet - which explains why you can see that the information on my skills is not full - however I jus wanted to showcase what it looks to users on the website. All buttons, links and pages work as intended and when users fill out the contact me section, I do indeed get the exact message from the user to my email. 
<br>
<br>
However, I feel as though it is almost as important to show the cons of my website; as i'll show you using my "about my website" page;

As you can see the format of this webpage is totally battered. I have no edited this page as I feel it is important for me to outline the problems of the page. With all the buttons working for each page on the menu bar, the pictures and text on the page are not as neat as they could be. This is due to me not aligning and fitting the write spaces around the text but also not wrapping the images so they they sit central to the page, or next to the text.

<br>
If anyone has any ideas to improve this pages layout, please let me know as I would love other peoples input on this project.
